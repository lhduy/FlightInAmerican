# Domestics Flight In American from 1998 to 2008
## Summary
### The objective of this exploratory is to show the variation of US flights between years and months.
## Desgin
### 1. I selected bar chart because it is a good visualization to describe my story. With colorbar, it is easily to see the difference between months per year. 
### 2. I also made it more interactively by time. It is useful when you are interested in a specific year.
### 3. A line chart of year agains number of flight has been added. Feel free to select month of interest.
