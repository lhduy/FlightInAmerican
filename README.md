# Domestics Flight In American from 1998 to 2008
## Summary
The objective of this visualization project is to study about the change of US domestics flights in a certain period from 1998 to 2008. From my exploration, there are 3 insights about this data:
1. Due to the advantage of technology, buying air-ticket is easier and cheaper in time. Consequently, more people prefer travelling by airplane.
2. Summer months (July and August) are the busiest period due to the high amount of vacations.
3. The September 11 attacks in 2001 caused the decreasing of US domestics flights in the end of 2001 and whole year 2002. This situation has improved since 2003.

## Design
1. I selected bar chart because it is a good visualization to describe my story. The highlighted bars (red) represent the summer months. It helps to compare those months with the others easily.
2. I also made 1st chart more interactively by time. It is useful when you are interested in a specific year.
3. I also add a control panel of month in the 1st chart. It will help reader to filter the month of interest.
4. A line chart of year from 1998 to 2008 agains number of flight has been added. From this chart, my readers could have an overview of Domestics American Flight in 10 years. Feel free to select month of interest.
5. I added the red line to indicate the September 11 attacks.
6. Because of limited time and resources, I decided only collect the data in 10 years from 1998 to 2008. My further exploration will focus on more data and other factors.

## Feedback
From: Ignotus
1. What do you notice in the visualization?
The visualization is clear and I like it.
2. What questions do you have about the data?
This data can be aligned with historical events, therefore during my exploration I have tried to map the historical timeline to correlations which have been noticed in the chart.
3. What relationships do you notice?
See (1). After 2000 amount of flights drastically changed in some reason.
4. What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Significant drop of number of flights after the event of 9/11 2001. There is the same annomaly happened for 2008. People don't flight on February much in comparison to other months. In general people tend to flight during spring or summer.
5. Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
Year: 24K, seems to be a bug, since amount of flight per month is already > 400K

1.	What do you notice in the visualization?
2 charts showing the change in the number of US domestic flights across 10 years.
2.	What questions do you have about the data?
It’s not clear what is the total number of domestic flights in a certain year. It would be nice to be able to see this as well to determine if the US airlines performed better between specific years.
3.	What relationships do you notice?
Overall the US airlines seemed to improve over time. However, the fluctuations across the months in each year stay relatively constant with the exception of year 2001.
4.	What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
I can understand better how the US airlines performed across the mentioned 10 years and across the months within each year.
5.	Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
My initial thought is that the bar chart with 12 different colors in the first chart does not add additional value to the story. But as I went through the years, the colors actually made it easier to observe the patterns across the months. Still, it would be nice to present this as a line chart across the months with the option to compare the patterns across a few years.

1.	What do you notice in the visualization?
I notice two charts illustrating the change of US domestic flight in 10 years. The charts are presented in different colors representing 12 months in a year. The animation also helps me see how the data changes over time in only one chart. 
2.	What questions do you have about the data?
We have a clear overview from 1998 to 2008. What happened from 2008 until now ?
3.	What relationships do you notice?
The difference of US domestic flight over years from 1998 till 2008 and every month within a year. 
4.	What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
I can see how US airlines performed for 10 years from 1998 till 2008
5.	Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
The line chart looks quite messy to me at first sight when I didn’t know I could show/hide each month of all years. I prefer the bar chart since I can compare the number of flights every month each year.
